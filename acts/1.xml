        <p>A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April,
            2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life,
            it is only today he will be given a name!</p>

        <p>What will the name of this young man be?</p>

        <p>Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are
            scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for
            REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.
            You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also
            like to play GAMES sometimes.</p>

        <p>What will you do?</p>

        <p>You retrieve your FAKE ARMS from the chest. You use these for HILARIOUS ANTICS. </p>

        <p>You CAPTCHALOGUE them in your SYLLADEX. You have no idea what that actually means
            though.</p>

        <p>Colonel Sassacre's DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL JAPERY</p>

        <p>Harry Anderson's WISE GUY</p>
        <p>In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating
            weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.</p>

        <p>You are neither of these things.</p>

        <p>Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX],
            ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1)
            PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and
            ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL
            JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S "WISE GUY", BY MIKE CAVENEY.</p>

        <p>Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the
            SMOKE PELLETS.</p>

        <p>sylladex::captchalogue deck</p>
        <p>You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.</p>

        <p>You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of
            the vernacular at least.</p>

        <p>You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.</p>

        <command>John: Equip fake arms.</command>
        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You aren't totally sure if "EQUIP" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral
            medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just
            used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order
            to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room
            lousy with smoke!</p>

        <p>Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE.
            You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and
            mildly irritating.</p>

        <p>But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your
            SYLLADEX with a little more experience.</p>

            poster was one of your wisest purchases.</p>

        <p>There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster

        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.</p>

        <p>But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try
            to take the NAILS? </p>

        <p>You guess it doesn't hurt to try.</p>

    <entry>
        <command>John: Take nails.</command>
        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a
            card.</p>

        <p>The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!</p>

        <p>Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do
            that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.</p>

        <p>In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business
            and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally
            meaningful.</p>

            you.</p>
        <p>TG: thank you</p>
        <p>EB: jk haha.</p>
        <p>EB: no, i don't have it yet.</p>
        <p>EB: my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's
            there.</p>
        <p>EB: and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid
            sylladex.</p>
        <p>EB: it's so frustrating.</p>
        <p>TG: whats your modus</p>
        <p>EB: what?</p>
        <p>TG: how do you retrieve artifacts from it</p>

        <p>EB: i guess.</p>
        <p>TG: did you at least allocate your strife specibus</p>
        <p>EB: no.</p>
        <p>TG: it could free up a card for you</p>
        <p>TG: plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle</p>
        <p>TG: which is never</p>
        <p>TG: what have you got</p>
        <p>EB: well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms.</p>
        <p>TG: wow you really suck at this dont you</p>
        <p>TG: just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus</p>
        <p>EB: how?</p>
        <p>TG: i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works</p>

        <p>Now that you've got some space in your SYLLADEX to work with, you figure you might as

        <p>Ordinarily this ridiculous book would be way too heavy to carry around in any practical
            way. You guess maybe this is one respect in which the cards present some

        <p>isn't as good as some</p>

        <p>FEATURE</p>

        <p>SBURB</p>

        <p>So ok. </p>

        <p>SBURB is this game that</p>
        <p>a lot of cats seem hella</p>
        <p>pumped of. And this beta</p>
        <p>is sitting on my desk for</p>
        <p>review, so I'm like, yeah</p>
        <p>man I'll write something. </p>

        <p>But I don't know. I'm like,</p>
        <p>so this is about houses or</p>
        <p>some noise? That's fine, I'm sure that's</p>
        <p>like fucking dynamite in a handbag for</p>
        <p>some brosephs. But all I'm saying is,</p>
        <p>when do you get to *thrash* anything?</p>
        <p>While you're playing house or some shit,</p>
        <p>are you ever in jeopardy of getting mud</p>
        <p>on your doll's dress or whatever from</p>
        <p>busting out, and I quote, "the mad</p>
        <p>stunts all wicked up-ins"?</p>

        <p>Know what I'm saying, Bro-Yo Ma? I</p>
        <p>didn't actually play this game, but I gave</p>
        <p>it 1.5 hats out of 5 hats to keep it real. </p>

        <p>At this point I'd like to give a shout out</p>
        <p>to my boy Dennis who was over the</p>
        <p>other day. We were going to chill in front</p>
        <p>of The Dark Knight and he was so</p>
        <p>psyched of it y'all.</p>

        <p>So this one time he was</p>
        <p>leaning against the screen</p>
        <p>door and the shit popped</p>
        <p>open, and the back deck</p>
        <p>was wet and he slipped</p>
        <p>down the steps and broke</p>
        <p>his thumb on the lawn. It</p>
        <p>wasn't a long fall, but hey I</p>
        <p>guess a thumb bone wasn't</p>
        <p>made for supporting the</p>
        <p>brunt of a huge useless tool</p>
        <p>against wet grass. We never did watch</p>
        <p>Dark Knight on account of Ron truck-</p>
        <p>ing his bawling candy-ass girth to the</p>
        <p>hospital. </p>

        <p>But it's cool, I still got another watch</p>
        <p>in me, Brotel Rwanda.</p>

        <p>BRO-NOTES :</p>
        <p>Dennis was so</p>
        <p>wasted, ha ha. I</p>
        <p>mean damn.</p>

        <p>A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and
            not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what
            FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all
            times, without exception.</p>

        <p>As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame
            for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's
            rays.</p>

        <p>"The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun." -Mark

        <p>EB: no, why would you even think that??</p>
        <p>EB: that's so stupid.</p>
        <p>TT: Ok.</p>

        <p>Hold fast my intrepid fellow prank-</p>

        <p>The door on the left leads to the KITCHEN, from which the smell of baking wafts -- a
            powerful aroma which could lift an especially portly hobo off his feet.</p>

        <p>The door on the right leads to the STUDY, where your DAD spends a lot of time. </p>

        <p>He could be in either room. Where will you go?</p>

        <p>THE SERIOUS JESTER</p>
        <p>On the desk is a DECK OF PLAYING CARDS, one of your DAD'S PIPES, the April issue of THE
            SERIOUS JESTER magazine, and a stray CAPTCHALOGUE CARD.</p>

        <p>There is also a CAN OF PEANUTS on the desk. Ha ha, oh DAD. You won't be falling for THAT
            one again any time soon.</p>

        <p>A severe peanut allergy is a terrible affliction to cope with.</p>

        <command>John: Combine second pipe with clever disguise.</command>
        <date>21/04/09</date>
        <p>Your DAD maintains numerous pipes around the household. A father without a pipe is like a
            strapping roughneck without a toothpick. That is to say, HE IS A RATHER PISS-POOR EXCUSE
            FOR A ROUGHNECK IF YOU ASK ME.</p>

        <p>You'd rather not take the PIPE, though. The first one tastes bad enough as it is.</p>

        <p>How you suffer for your comedy.</p>

            rendering it an especially foolish version of Solitaire.</p>

        <p>SO STUPID. Look at this mess.</p>

        <p>The peanut gallery over there sure is getting a kick out of it. You are allergic to their

        <p>Hi-C ECTO COOLER</p>
        <p>You go back into the LIVING ROOM and contemplate checking the mailbox outside. You think
            perhaps you should exhaust all possibilities before plunging headlong into a DAD
            encounter.</p>

        <p>Your TELEVISION is currently airing a COMMERCIAL.</p>

        <p>HOMESTUCK</p>
        <p>The streets are empty. Wind skims the voids keeping neighbors apart, as if grazing the
            hollow of a cut reed, or say, a plundered mailbox. A familiar note is produced. It's the
            one Desolation plays to keep its instrument in tune.</p>

        <p>It is your thirteenth birthday, and as with all twelve preceding it, something feels
            missing from your life. The game presently eluding you is only the latest sleight of
            hand in the repertoire of an unseen riddler, one to engender a sense not of mirth, but
            of lack. His coarse schemes are those less of a prankster than a common pickpocket. His
            riddle is Absence itself. It is a mystery dispersing altogether, like the moon's faint
            reflection, with even one pebble of inquiry dropped in its black well. It is the most
            diabolical riddle of all.</p>

        <p>"Absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones, as wind extinguishes
            candles and fans a fire." -Walt Whitman</p>

        <p>Yes, you are certain Walt Whitman said that. One hundred percent positive.</p>

        <p>You have a feeling it's going to be a long day.</p>

        <date>24/04/09</date>
        <p>The door is locked and your DAD has the CAR KEYS. You peer in through the driver's side
            window.</p>

        <p>You don't see any mail, but you do see a GREEN PACKAGE. There is also something
            underneath it that looks like a slip of paper. </p>

        <p>Could these items have come in the mail? You don't see anything else that's usually in
            the mail, like bills and coupons. Maybe your DAD forgot to take this stuff inside.</p>

            seems your DAD has been doing so much baking, the glass has steamed up.</p>

        <p>God he is so weird.</p>

        <p>But you can see what's on the table just beside the window. It looks like the mail is
            there! Included among it is a RED PACKAGE, some BILLS, your DAD'S PDA, and an envelope
            that appears to be suspiciously labeled with the SBURB LOGO. Could it be???</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the window is locked.</p>

        <p>Your spare CAPTCHALOGUE CARD is forced out of the SYLLADEX, and consequently integrated

        <p>To the left is the BATHROOM. To the right is your DAD'S ROOM. It is locked, and you are

            crown is the SWING SET which has provided you with years of joy. There is also a
            SPRING-MOUNTED POGO-RIDE, which has been responsible for more than one painful injury,
            and has provided you with years of lament.</p>

        <p>On the sink is your DAD'S RAZOR. On the rack to the side is a FRESH TOWEL.</p>

        <p>failure to launch</p>
        <p>You're not usually into chick-flicks, but Matthew McConaughey's cool charisma could
            salvage any heap of smoldering wreckage. </p>

        <p>This is your "McConaughey Wall", a casual shrine to an amazing actor. The film above that
            one is a lot better, you think.</p>

        <p>CAN YOU SEE HER? I WANT YOU TO PICTURE THAT LITTLE GIRL. [chokes up] NOW IMAGINE SHE'S
            WHITE. </p>

        <p>You got us Matthew! Your smooth talking exposed our latent racism! Damn you are good!</p>

        <p>TG: you should probably open it</p>
        <p>EB: i would, but it's trapped under the sburb beta, so i will probably open it after i

        <p>DATA STRUCTURES for ASSHOLES</p>
        <p>By Buckminster Funnyuncle</p>

        <p>Your ignorance just made me throw up a little. Get a clue, you computer-illiterate piece
            of shit.</p>

        <p>FREE FETCH MODUS IN BACK!!!</p>
        <p>You're not sure you really want to dig into this huge tome. It looks really boring. And
            kind of ornery.</p>

        <p>Maybe you'll just check out that free modus instead.</p>
    </entry>
    <entry>
        <command>John: Get free Fetch Modus.</command>

        <p>fetch modus</p>
        <p>FIFO</p>
        <p>queue</p>
        <p>You turn to the back inside cover, where a free FETCH MODUS is included in a plastic
            sleeve.</p>

        <p>This one is dictated by the logic of a QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE, operating on a "First In,
            First Out" method, rather than a "First In, Last Out" method of a STACK.</p>
    </entry>
    <entry>
        <command>John: Apply Fetch Modus to Sylladex.</command>
        <date>05/05/09</date>
        <p>Items captchalogued in your SYLLADEX are no longer immediately accessible. You can only
            use the item on the bottom card, and must wait for items on upper cards to be pushed
            back to it.</p>

        <p>For instance, the RED PACKAGE is now inaccessible. You can only use the RAZOR at the
            moment.</p>

        <p>This modus doesn't strike you as a significant upgrade to your previous one. In fact, it
            almost seems more inconvenient. You figure you might as well give it a chance
            though.</p>

        <p>FILO</p>

        <p>You suddenly wonder if this is even possible. You don't even remember if you ever had a
            physical card for the STACK MODUS.</p>

        <p>You find this all to be a little abstract and you'd prefer not to think about it too
            much.</p>

    <entry>
        <command>==&gt;</command>
        <date>08/05/09</date>
        <p>It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one held hostage briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus "The
            Virus" while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the
            one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his
            daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe
            wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.</p>

        <p>But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is
            the VERY SAME BUNNY.</p>

        <p>This is so awesome.</p>

        <p>The following matters have been submitted in a frank and forthright</p>
        <p>manner for pipefan413's judicious appraisal.</p>

        <p>f grayslacks66 - 17:24</p>

        <p>Decided to return home for fresh tie. Soiled tie will be laundered</p>
        <p>immediately upon return</p>

        <p>f wellPressedAttire - 17:23</p>

        <p>Use ballpoint pen to roll up tip of cloth. Extract pen. Press rolled</p>
        <p>cloth against ceramic surface, e.g. restroom sink. In future: consider</p>
        <p>repositioning hat hook and/or coffee pot.</p>

        <p>f officeurchin1280 - 17:23</p>

        <p>Photographic documentation of incident?</p>

        <p>f grayslacks66 - 17:22</p>

        <p>Was posturing unevenly to reach for hat on wall hook. Tip of tie</p>
        <p>slipped in open mouth of pot. Duration of "dunk": approx. 3 seconds.</p>

        <p>f 2busy4this - 17:22</p>

        <p>pl elab on 'incident'</p>

        <p>f grayslacks66 - 17:21</p>

        <p>Need counsel on removing coffee from necktie. Incident occurred 45</p>
        <p>seconds ago. Beverage essences rapidly settling into fabric.</p>

        <p>[SYSTEM]</p>
        <p>You grab the PDA, switching back to STACK MODUS so it is readily accessible.</p>

        <p>The interface is oddly sterile. No hilarious clown wallpapers or anything like that.
            (Oops, you mean harlequin wallpapers.)</p>

        <p>The SERIOUS BUSINESS application is open. It seems your DAD uses it to keep tabs on
            various acquaintances... his fellow street performers, maybe?</p>

        <p>You guess the performing arts must be pretty serious business after all.</p>

        <p>TT: I'm working on the bathroom.</p>
        <p>TT: But we are running low on Build Grist.</p>
        <p>EB: oh man who cares about the bathroom, now there's a meteor heading for my house!!!</p>
        <p>TT: I see.</p>
        <p>TT: Do you suppose it has anything to do with the game?</p>
        <p>EB: i don't know, maybe! what do i do!</p>
        <p>TT: I think it's very likely.</p>
        <p>TT: The walkthroughs vaguely suggest an impending threat before they end.</p>
        <p>TT: The already poorly constructed sentences become even more curt and ambiguous.</p>
        <p>TT: As if written hastily and with a sense of alarm.</p>
        <p>TT: Actually, their dedication to updating the walkthrough under such circumstances is
            admirable.</p>
        <p>EB: wow, FASCINATING.</p>
        <p>EB: ??????</p>
        <p>TT: If the meteor is a game construct, I think the only thing to do is to proceed, and
            try to solve the dilemma on the game's terms.</p>
        <p>TT: Try using the lathe.</p>
        <p>TT: It says you can use the card on it, but isn't more specific than that.</p>
        <p>EB: ok i'll do that.</p>
        <p>TT: Really, it is a labor to read this drivel.</p>
        <p>TT: If I read any more my brain will need to be spoon-fed from a jar.</p>
        <p>TT: While it blows spit bubbles in a highchair.</p>
        <p>TT: I think I will write my own walkthrough.</p>
        <p>TT: That is, after we make sure you don't die.</p>

        <p>TG: i heard you got the box</p>
        <p>TG: i hope you appreciate my heroic fatherly perseverance in getting it to you</p>
        <p>TG: in my rough and tumble dirty wifebeaterly sort of way</p>
        <p>TG: also i hope you appreciate how many no-talent douches had their mitts on that bunny
            before you</p>
        <p>TG: its like a grubby baton in some huge douchebag marathon</p>
        <p>TG: hey where are you</p>
        <p>EB: oh man, the bunny was awesome, but i don't have time to talk, i'm playing sburb and
            it's kind of a nightmare.</p>
        <p>EB: TT is breaking everything in my house.</p>
        <p>TG: dude i told you to steer clear of that game</p>
        <p>TG: and for that matter you should probably wash your hands of flighty broads and their
            snarky horseshit altogether</p>
        <p>EB: and now there's a meteor coming, and i'm not even joking about that!!!</p>
        <p>EB: it's like a big asteroid or comet or something.</p>
        <p>EB: in the sky.</p>
        <p>EB: heading right for my house!!!!!!!!</p>
        <p>TG: oh man</p>
        <p>TG: how big is it</p>
        <p>EB: i dunno.</p>
        <p>EB: big, i guess.</p>
        <p>EB: i gotta go!</p>
        <p>EB: we'll talk later if i am still alive and the earth isn't blown up.</p>
        <p>TG: like the size of texas</p>
        <p>TG: or just rhode island</p>
        <p>TG: theyre always throwing around these geographical comparisons to give us a sense of
            scale like it really means anything to us</p>
        <p>TG: but its like it doesnt matter its always just like: WOW THATS PRETTY FUCKING BIG</p>
        <p>TG: like mr president theres a meteor coming sir. oh yeah, how big is it? its the size of
            texas sir</p>
        <p>TG: OH SHIT</p>
        <p>TG: or, how big is it? its the size of new york city sir</p>
        <p>TG: OH SHIT</p>
        <p>TG: sir im afraid the comet is the size of your moms dick</p>

        <p>Your name is ROSE. As was previously mentioned you are without ELECTRICITY, although your
            LAPTOP COMPUTER still functions on BATTERY POWER. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You
            have a passion for RATHER OBSCURE LITERATURE. You enjoy creative writing and are
            SOMEWHAT SECRETIVE ABOUT IT. You have a fondness for the BESTIALLY STRANGE AND
            FICTITIOUS, and sometimes dabble in PSYCHOANALYSIS. You also like to KNIT, and your room
            is a BIT OF A MESS. And on occasion, if just the right one strikes your fancy, you like
            to play VIDEO GAMES with your friends.</p>

        <p>Your panoramic window offers a view of your yard below, and the mausoleum housing your
            dead cat, JASPERS, who died when you were young. Your MOM had the structure erected with
            a spirit of scornful IRONY in response to your youthfully innocent request to hold a
            funeral for the animal. At least, that is how you have come to interpret the gesture in
            retrospect.</p>

        <p>You can also make out a silhouette of the LABORATORY next door, a facility which likely
            broadcasts a strong WIRELESS INTERNET SIGNAL. You may be able to connect to the signal
            from a different part of the house. Perhaps if you seek higher ground?</p>

        <p>This causes the tree to be unbalanced, so your SYLLADEX auto-balances itself. Now the
            LAPTOP occupies the ROOT CARD, while the other two items comprise the LEAVES.</p>

        <p>Hanging just next to your door in the hallway is a painting of an EXQUISITE WIZARD. Your
            mother collects these awful things IRONICALLY. She must know how much you detest them,
            and there is no doubt in your mind she stores these dreadful things in the house to
            bother you.</p>

        <p>Down the hall to the right is the way to the OBSERVATORY. Perhaps you will be able to
            connect from up there?</p>

        <p>You find a gap in the clouds. It seems a flurry of smaller METEOROIDS is streaking
            steadily overhead. You're not sure what this means, but it is somewhat
            disconcerting.</p>
