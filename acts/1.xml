        <p>A young man stands in his bedroom. It just so happens that today, the 13th of April,
            2009, is this young man's birthday. Though it was thirteen years ago he was given life,
            it is only today he will be given a name!</p>
        <p>What will the name of this young man be?</p>

        <p>Your name is JOHN. As was previously mentioned it is your BIRTHDAY. A number of CAKES are
            scattered about your room. You have a variety of INTERESTS. You have a passion for
            REALLY TERRIBLE MOVIES. You like to program computers but you are NOT VERY GOOD AT IT.
            You have a fondness for PARANORMAL LORE, and are an aspiring AMATEUR MAGICIAN. You also
            like to play GAMES sometimes.</p>
        <p>What will you do?</p>

        </img-txt>
        <p>In here you keep an array of humorous and mystical ARTIFACTS, each one a devastating
            weapon in the hands of a SKILLED MAGICIAN or a CUNNING PRANKSTER.</p>
        <p>You are neither of these things.</p>
        <p>Among the ARTIFACTS are: TWO (2) FAKE ARMS [CURRENTLY CAPTCHALOGUED IN YOUR SYLLADEX],
            ONE (1) PAIR OF TRICK HANDCUFFS, ONE (1) STUNT SWORD, ONE (1) MAGICIAN'S HAT, ONE (1)
            PAIR OF BEAGLE PUSS GLASSES, SEVERAL (~) SMOKE PELLETS, SEVERAL (~) BLOOD CAPSULES, and
            ONE (1) COPY OF COLONEL SASSACRE'S DAUNTING TEXT OF MAGICAL FRIVOLITY AND PRACTICAL
            JAPERY, and ONE (1) COPY OF HARRY ANDERSON'S "WISE GUY", BY MIKE CAVENEY.</p>
        <p>Some of this stuff may come in handy at some point. For now, you decide to just take the
            SMOKE PELLETS.</p>

        </img-txt>
        <p>You stow the SMOKE PELLETS on one of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS in your SYLLADEX.</p>
        <p>You still aren't totally sure what that means, but you are starting to get the hang of
            the vernacular at least.</p>
        <p>You have two empty CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS remaining.</p>

        <command>John: Equip fake arms.</command>
        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You aren't totally sure if "EQUIP" is a verb copasetic with the abstract behavioral
            medium in which you dwell, but you give it a try anyway.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you cannot access the FAKE ARMS! Their card is underneath the one you just
            used to captchalogue the SMOKE PELLETS. You will have to use the pellets first in order
            to access the arms. But this is probably unadvisable, since you'd just make your room
            lousy with smoke!</p>
        <p>Your SYLLADEX'S FETCH MODUS is currently dictated by the logic of a STACK DATA STRUCTURE.
            You were never all that great with data structures and you find the concept puzzling and
            mildly irritating.</p>
        <p>But with any hope, perhaps you will advance new, more practical FETCH MODI for your
            SYLLADEX with a little more experience.</p>

        <p>Is it even possible to get any more hard boiled than that? You really doubt it. This
            poster was one of your wisest purchases.</p>
        <p>There is a nice spot on the wall next to it. You've been meaning to hang another poster
            there soon.</p>

        <command>John: Acquire hammer and nails. They will come in handy.</command>
        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You first place the HAMMER into your SYLLADEX.</p>
        <p>But now all of your CAPTCHALOGUE CARDS are full. You wonder what will happen if you try
            to take the NAILS?</p>
        <p>You guess it doesn't hurt to try.</p>
    </entry>
    <entry>
        <command>John: Take nails.</command>
        <date>13/04/09</date>
        <p>You captchalogue FOUR (4) NAILS into the top card, and push all the ARTIFACTS down a
            card.</p>
        <p>The FAKE ARMS are pushed entirely out of the deck!!!</p>
        <p>Oh well. They're probably completely useless anyway. But you probably don't want to do
            that again, unless you want to drop the SMOKE PELLETS and suffer the consequences.</p>
        <p>In any case, you now feel like you have gathered enough things to get down to business
            and do some really important stuff. The next thing you do will probably be exceptionally
            meaningful.</p>

        <p>You decide to consult with the Colonel's bottomless wisdom. Good grief this thing is
            huge. It could kill a cat if you dropped it.</p>
        <p>But to really dig into this hefty book, you will have to captchalogue it. You are not
            sure you are ready to logjam your other ARTIFACTS beneath it just yet.</p>

            <p>a lot of cats seem hella</p>
            <p>pumped of. And this beta</p>
            <p>is sitting on my desk for</p>
            <p>review, so I'm like, yeah</p>
            <p>man I'll write something.</p>
            <p>But I don't know. I'm like,</p>
            <p>so this is about houses or</p>
            <p>some noise? That's fine, I'm sure that's</p>
            <p>like fucking dynamite in a handbag for</p>
            <p>some brosephs. But all I'm saying is,</p>
            <p>when do you get to *thrash* anything?</p>
            <p>While you're playing house or some shit,</p>
            <p>are you ever in jeopardy of getting mud</p>
            <p>on your doll's dress or whatever from</p>
            <p>busting out, and I quote, "the mad</p>
            <p>stunts all wicked up-ins"?</p>
            <p>Know what I'm saying, Bro-Yo Ma? I</p>
            <p>didn't actually play this game, but I gave</p>
            <p>it 1.5 hats out of 5 hats to keep it real.</p>
            <p>At this point I'd like to give a shout out</p>
            <p>to my boy Dennis who was over the</p>
            <p>other day. We were going to chill in front</p>
            <p>of The Dark Knight and he was so</p>
            <p>psyched of it y'all.</p>
            <p>So this one time he was</p>
            <p>leaning against the screen</p>
            <p>door and the shit popped</p>
            <p>open, and the back deck</p>
            <p>was wet and he slipped</p>
            <p>down the steps and broke</p>
            <p>his thumb on the lawn. It</p>
            <p>wasn't a long fall, but hey I</p>
            <p>guess a thumb bone wasn't</p>
            <p>made for supporting the</p>
            <p>brunt of a huge useless tool</p>
            <p>against wet grass. We never did watch</p>
            <p>Dark Knight on account of Ron truck-</p>
            <p>ing his bawling candy-ass girth to the</p>
            <p>hospital.</p>
            <p>But it's cool, I still got another watch</p>

        <p>John? Who is this "John" you speak of? You are quite certain there has never been, nor
            ever will be...</p>
        <p>Yeah, this is a really shitty disguise.</p>
        <p>While you are wearing the items, they remain on the card, but it is temporarily removed
            from the deck, thus freeing up the cards beneath it.</p>

        <p>On one wall hangs a picture of a fella who sure knows how to have a laugh, a man after
            your own heart. You always thought he looked a lot like Michael Cera. But your DAD
            swears on the many HALLOWED TOMBS of Egypt that it is not. You're not sure about that
            though.</p>
        <p>On the other wall is one of your DAD'S stupid clowns. Or HARLEQUINS, as he is quick to
            correct anyone who would venture such brazen assumption.</p>

        <p>The accursed odor of fresh baking wafts into your newfound nostrils. Something is brewing
            in the KITCHEN. It must be the connivings of your arch nemesis, BETTY CROCKER, and the
            rich, buttery aroma of her plot stinks to high heaven.</p>

        <date>18/04/09</date>
        <p>A bright orange flame flickers in the FIREPLACE. It doesn't matter that it's April and
            not terribly chilly outside. In a home, a FIREPLACE needs a fire, because that's what
            FIREPLACE is for. A fire BELONGS in a FIREPLACE, dammit, cata(ptcha)gorically, at all
            times, without exception.</p>
        <p>As domestic myth of unaccountable origin holds, a home borrows the spirit of the flame
            for as long as it makes a guest of it, much as the moon takes liberty with the sun's
            rays.</p>
        <p>"The moon's an arrant thief, and her pale fire she snatches from the sun." -Mark
            Twain</p>
        <p>You are almost certain Mark Twain said that.</p>

        <p>The streets are empty. Wind skims the voids keeping neighbors apart, as if grazing the
            hollow of a cut reed, or say, a plundered mailbox. A familiar note is produced. It's the
            one Desolation plays to keep its instrument in tune.</p>
        <p>It is your thirteenth birthday, and as with all twelve preceding it, something feels
            missing from your life. The game presently eluding you is only the latest sleight of
            hand in the repertoire of an unseen riddler, one to engender a sense not of mirth, but
            of lack. His coarse schemes are those less of a prankster than a common pickpocket. His
            riddle is Absence itself. It is a mystery dispersing altogether, like the moon's faint
            reflection, with even one pebble of inquiry dropped in its black well. It is the most
            diabolical riddle of all.</p>
        <p>"Absence diminishes little passions and increases great ones, as wind extinguishes

        <command>John: See if your father left the mail in the car.</command>
        <date>24/04/09</date>
        <p>The door is locked and your DAD has the CAR KEYS. You peer in through the driver's side
            window.</p>
        <p>You don't see any mail, but you do see a GREEN PACKAGE. There is also something
            underneath it that looks like a slip of paper.</p>
        <p>Could these items have come in the mail? You don't see anything else that's usually in
            the mail, like bills and coupons. Maybe your DAD forgot to take this stuff inside.</p>

        <p>You try to get a gander through the KITCHEN WINDOW, but you can't see a whole lot! It
            seems your DAD has been doing so much baking, the glass has steamed up.</p>
        <p>God he is so weird.</p>
        <p>But you can see what's on the table just beside the window. It looks like the mail is
            there! Included among it is a RED PACKAGE, some BILLS, your DAD'S PDA, and an envelope
            that appears to be suspiciously labeled with the SBURB LOGO. Could it be???</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the window is locked.</p>

        <p>Your spare CAPTCHALOGUE CARD is forced out of the SYLLADEX, and consequently integrated

        <p>To the left is the BATHROOM. To the right is your DAD'S ROOM. It is locked, and you are

            SPRING-MOUNTED POGO-RIDE, which has been responsible for more than one painful injury,
            and has provided you with years of lament.</p>
        <p>On the sink is your DAD'S RAZOR. On the rack to the side is a FRESH TOWEL.</p>

            <p>DATA STRUCTURES for ASSHOLES</p>
            <p>By Buckminster Funnyuncle</p>
            <p>Your ignorance just made me throw up a little. Get a clue, you computer-illiterate
                piece of shit.</p>
            <p>FREE FETCH MODUS IN BACK!!!</p>
        </img-txt>
        <p>You're not sure you really want to dig into this huge tome. It looks really boring. And
            kind of ornery.</p>
        <p>Maybe you'll just check out that free modus instead.</p>

        </img-txt>
        <p>You turn to the back inside cover, where a free FETCH MODUS is included in a plastic
            sleeve.</p>
        <p>This one is dictated by the logic of a QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE, operating on a "First In,
            First Out" method, rather than a "First In, Last Out" method of a STACK.</p>

        <command>John: Apply Fetch Modus to Sylladex.</command>
        <date>05/05/09</date>
        <p>Items captchalogued in your SYLLADEX are no longer immediately accessible. You can only
            use the item on the bottom card, and must wait for items on upper cards to be pushed
            back to it.</p>
        <p>For instance, the RED PACKAGE is now inaccessible. You can only use the RAZOR at the
            moment.</p>
        <p>This modus doesn't strike you as a significant upgrade to your previous one. In fact, it
            almost seems more inconvenient. You figure you might as well give it a chance
            though.</p>

        </img-txt>
        <p>You suddenly wonder if this is even possible. You don't even remember if you ever had a
            physical card for the STACK MODUS.</p>
        <p>You find this all to be a little abstract and you'd prefer not to think about it too
            much.</p>

        <p>It is a STUFFED BUNNY. Much like the one held hostage briefly by Malkovich's Cyrus "The
            Virus" while taunting hard-luck protagonist Cameron Poe. And strikingly similar to the
            one scooped up from the soot of a burning Vegas strip by Cage's Poe and offered to his
            daughter, a gesture symbolic of a tattered exterior surrounding a heart of gold. Poe
            wasn't much to look at. But he was a good man.</p>
        <p>But no, it is not merely LIKE that bunny. According to this NOTE OF AUTHENTICITY, it is
            the VERY SAME BUNNY.</p>
        <p>This is so awesome.</p>

        <p>You snatch the TELESCOPE from its TRIPOD. Who knows, it might be useful. But more
            importantly, it pushes the CRUXITE to the last card making it available for
            tinkering.</p>

        <p>It is tempting because they strongly resemble Rockin' Blue Raspberry Gushers. However,

        <command>Rose: Get violin.</command>
        <date>28/05/09</date>
        <p>You captchalogue the VIOLIN, storing it the ROOT CARD of your SYLLADEX.</p>

        <command>[S] Rose: Play a haunting refrain on the violin.</command>
        <date>28/05/09</date>
        <p>You waste approximately 40 seconds playing the violin while your friend is in peril.</p>
        <p>Nice time management skills there, sweetheart!</p>

        <command>John: Tell Liv Tyler you love her before impact.</command>
        <date>30/05/09</date>
        <p>Since your good for nothing friend is obviously not going to bail you out in time, you
            issue words of parting fondness to dear, sweet Liv. Oh, if only Affleck could have been
            the one to make the final sacrifice instead of her stubborn, blue collar,
            salt-of-the-earth father. Then she would fall into your arms for consolation, and YOU
            would be the one to make the deceased Bruce Willis proud.</p>

        <command>Rose: Captchalogue knitting supply bag.</command>
        <date>30/05/09</date>
        <p>You get the KNITTING BAG. It occupies the LEFT LEAF CARD under the VIOLIN, per the TREE
            MODUS'S alphabetical sorting method.</p>

        <command>Rose: Look out window.</command>
        <date>30/05/09</date>
        <p>Your panoramic window offers a view of your yard below, and the mausoleum housing your
            dead cat, JASPERS, who died when you were young. Your MOM had the structure erected with
            a spirit of scornful IRONY in response to your youthfully innocent request to hold a
            funeral for the animal. At least, that is how you have come to interpret the gesture in
            retrospect.</p>
        <p>You can also make out a silhouette of the LABORATORY next door, a facility which likely
            broadcasts a strong WIRELESS INTERNET SIGNAL. You may be able to connect to the signal
            from a different part of the house. Perhaps if you seek higher ground?</p>

        <command>Rose: Get laptop.</command>
        <date>30/05/09</date>
        <p>You take your LAPTOP and prepare to make the journey through the house.</p>
        <p>L &lt; V. L &gt; K.</p>
        <p>This causes the tree to be unbalanced, so your SYLLADEX auto-balances itself. Now the
            LAPTOP occupies the ROOT CARD, while the other two items comprise the LEAVES.</p>

        <command>Rose: Go explore the house.</command>
        <date>01/06/09</date>
        <p>You leave your BEDROOM.</p>
        <p>Hanging just next to your door in the hallway is a painting of an EXQUISITE WIZARD. Your
            mother collects these awful things IRONICALLY. She must know how much you detest them,
            and there is no doubt in your mind she stores these dreadful things in the house to
            bother you.</p>
        <p>Down the hall to the right is the way to the OBSERVATORY. Perhaps you will be able to
            connect from up there?</p>
        <p>Your mother's room is also in that direction. You will have to watch your step.</p>

        <p>This door leads up to the OBSERVATORY. You haven't ventured up there in quite some

    <entry>
        <command>Rose: Go through door.</command>
        <date>02/06/09</date>
        <p>The door opens to an exterior walkway, leading to the observatory entrance.</p>
        <p>You've seen less inclement weather before. Oh the things you'll do to help out a
            friend.</p>

        <p>You first put your LAPTOP down on the floor to get it situated.</p>
        <p>But removing it from the ROOT CARD causes all the branches and leaves to be severed! Your
            items are dumped unceremoniously on the floor.</p>

        <command>Rose: See what you can observe.</command>
        <date>04/06/09</date>
        <p>You're in a hurry, sure, but that doesn't mean you can't take moment to peek through the
            HUGE TELESCOPE.</p>
        <p>You find a gap in the clouds. It seems a flurry of smaller METEOROIDS is streaking
            steadily overhead. You're not sure what this means, but it is somewhat
            disconcerting.</p>

        <p>There are several signals being broadcasted from the LABORATORY, each of relatively
            decent strength.</p>
        <p>One of them is mysteriously and quite conveniently UNSECURED, requiring no password.</p>
        <p>You select the signal, and reconnect to the game with John.</p>
